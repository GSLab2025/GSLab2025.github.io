        <h1>Welcome to the Ganesh Sivaraman Lab!</h1>
        <p>Our research group is based at the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/materials-design-innovation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Materials Design & Innovation, University at Buffalo</a>. Our group develops and advances machine-learning–driven computational models to accelerate atomistic simulations of materials and molecules. We leverage some of the nation’s most powerful open-science high-performance computing resources—including the U.S. Department of Energy’s Exascale systems, New York State’s Empire AI infrastructure, and UB’s Center for Computational Research—to address grand challenges in materials design, characterization, and personalized medicine.</p>

      <h2>Our research is organized into three key thrust areas:</h2>

      <h3>Thrust 1: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) with Long-Range Physics</h3>
      <p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionised molecular simulations by achieving near–quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the cost. Our group develops automated active-learning algorithms for MLIP training and explores novel strategies to incorporate long-range physics into these models. We are also pioneering life-long-learning frameworks that enable models to efficiently retain and reuse knowledge across diverse materials systems.</p>

      <h3>Thrust 2: AI-Guided Discovery of BPA-Free Dental Monomers</h3>
      <p>Building upon our methodological advances in MLIPs, we are collaborating with UB’s School of Dental Medicine to design safer, high-performance dental resins. Current bisphenol A–based (Bis-GMA) materials pose health risks and exhibit long-term mechanical degradation. Through an AI-guided, computational-experimental co-design pipeline, we aim to discover BPA-free monomers with superior mechanical and biocompatible properties.</p>

      <h3>Thrust 3: MLIP-Driven Characterization of Real-World Experiments</h3>
      <p>In collaboration with scientists at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory), we apply our MLIP methodologies to interpret and accelerate experimental materials characterization, bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental observation.</p>
